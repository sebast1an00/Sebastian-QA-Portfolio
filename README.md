# Sebastian-QA-Portfolio
Welcome to my Quality Assurance (QA) Portfolio.
This repository showcases my testing skills through real test documentation, bug reports, and structured QA processes.
All files here demonstrate how I plan, design, execute, and report software tests in a professional environment.
